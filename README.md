# Alternative Bazel Registry

## Overview

Contributing to the bazel central registry, requires you to sign a google Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that transfers the copyright to google. Which is obviously not very "contributor" friendly. This is a fork of the registy, but you can make contributions here without signing any CLA.

## Contributing

Make sure to test your stuff, I don't have time.

## Additional Modules

This registry has everything in original "Google" registry in addition to:
- fmi4cpp (see the README first, this needs some dev libs on linux)
- csv
- pugixml
- units
